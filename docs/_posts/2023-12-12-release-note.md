# December 2023 (version 1.354.0)

Welcome to the May release of OnlineWardleyMaps.  Minor release to bring Quality of Life improvements.

# Quality of Life Improvements

## Presentation / Editor Mode 

A beta feature (https://beta.onlinewardleymaps.com) promoted to current live site.  This will allow you to hide the map text / editor to give a fullscreen view of the map.  This will also allow maps to be viewed from a mobile device in portrait mode.
 
## Usage Guide

Until today, the documentation website (this website) was not accessible via the onlinewardleymaps.com website.  A navigational link has been added into the "More" menu (top right) and in the footer.
